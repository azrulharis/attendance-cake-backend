Installation
-------------


- Download the plugin and put it in your 'app/Plugin' or 'plugins' folder
- Configure the 'admin' route (see http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/routing.html)
- Configure the plugin according to your web application:

	Some settings have to be read by CakePHP when the plugin is loaded. They can be found
	in the 'Acl/Config/bootstrap.php' file.
	
	You have two options to use these settings, as CakePHP doesn't automatically load 
	the bootstrap.php files in plugins:
	
	1.	Copy all the settings in your app/config/bootstrap.php file
	
	or
	
	2.	Load the plugin bootstrap with the plugin
	
	        CakePlugin::load('Acl', array('bootstrap' => true));

- Make sure the AclComponent is declared in your AppController and that your User and Group/Role models are configured to act as requester (see the CakePHP ACL tutorial)  
- Access the ACL plugin by navigating to /admin/acl


About CakePHP 2.0
-----------------

If you use CakePHP version 2.0, the plugin will work only if you do not use the E_STRICT error reporting level.

You can use E_STRICT error reporting level with CakePHP 2.1 or above.
