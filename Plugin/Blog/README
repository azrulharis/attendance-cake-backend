This CakePHP plugin is an interface to manage an Menu protected web application.

Installation
-------------

- Download the plugin and put it in your 'app/Plugin' or 'plugins' folder
- Configure the 'admin' route (see http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/routing.html)
- Configure the plugin according to your web application:

	Some settings have to be read by CakePHP when the plugin is loaded. They can be found
	in the 'Content/Config/bootstrap.php' file.
	
	You have two options to use these settings, as CakePHP doesn't automatically load 
	the bootstrap.php files in plugins:
	
	1.	Copy all the settings in your app/config/bootstrap.php file
	
	or
	
	2.	Load the plugin bootstrap with the plugin
	
	        CakePlugin::load('Content', array('bootstrap' => true));

- Make sure the MenuComponent is declared in your AppController and that your User and Group/Role models are configured to act as requester  
- Access the Menu plugin by navigating to /admin/content
